<h1 align="center">Basic Informational Site</h1>

## Description

The main purpose of this small project is to practice **Node.js** hosting a server in `localhost:8080` with a basic site containing 4 pages: _index_, _about_, _contact-me_ and _404_.

- The **Node.js** server is hosted in _index.js_
- `localhost:8080` should take users to _index.html_
- `localhost:8080/about_` should take users to _about.html_
- `localhost:8080/contact-me_` should take users to _contact-me.html_
- _404.html_ should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
